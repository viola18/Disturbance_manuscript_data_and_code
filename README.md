# Disturbance_manuscript_data_and_code

These are the datasets and code used in the "Multiple Urban and Agricultural Disturbances Drive Water Quality Degradation across United States Lakes: A National-Scale Predictive Framework" manuscript that's currently under review.

The full_predictors_human_disturb_July2023.csv and no_missing_NLA_final.csv are the datasets used to build the structural equation model (SEM). 
The LAGOS_Disturbance_Final_SEM.RMD contains the R code used to build the SEM. 
The results and predictions from SEM were saved in the SEM_predictions_bounded.csv. 
The GBM_SHAP_Inlake_Predicting.RMD contains the R code used for gradient boosting machine modelling and generating Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) plots.
